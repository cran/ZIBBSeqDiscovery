Description: Microbiome count data (Operational Taxonomic Unit, OTUs) is usually overdispersed and has excessive zero counts. The 'ZIBBSeqDiscovery' assumes a zero-inflated beta-binomial model for the distribution of the count data, and employes link functions to adjust interested covariates. To fit the model, two approaches are proposed (i) a free approach which treats the overdispersion parameters for OTUs as independent, and (ii) a constrained approach which proposes a mean-overdispersion relationship to the count data. This package can be used to test the association between the composition of the microbiome counts and the interested covariates.
